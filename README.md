# Objective:
The objective of this task is to develop and deploy a Java-based application using AWS services. The process begins by building the Java application locally. Once the application is successfully compiled and packaged (e.g., using Maven or Gradle), it will be containerized using Docker to create a lightweight, portable image. This Docker image will then be pushed to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR), which serves as a secure and scalable repository for container images.
After storing the image in ECR, the next step involves deploying the application using Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS). ECS will orchestrate and manage the running containers, allowing the application to scale and operate efficiently in a cloud environment. This workflow enables continuous integration and deployment, improves portability, and simplifies management of the application lifecycle in a production-ready environment.
