# Elastic Container Registry (ECR)
ECR = Docker hub
Amazon ECR is a fully managed Docker container registry that makes it easy to store, manage, and deploy Docker container images.

## Key Features:

* Secure & Private: Stores Docker images in AWS, accessible only to authorized users.

* Integrated with ECS: Seamlessly works with Amazon ECS for deploying containerized applications.

* Version Control: Supports image versioning and lifecycle policies for managing old images.

* Highly Available: Built on Amazon S3, ensuring durability and availability.

## Use Case:

You build a Docker image of your Java application and push it to ECR.

ECS then pulls this image to deploy your application.


# Elastic Container service(ECS):
ECS = More than Docker Swarm 

Amazon ECS is a highly scalable container orchestration service that allows you to run, stop, and manage Docker containers on a cluster.

## Key Features:

 - Supports Docker: Runs containers using Docker images (stored in ECR).

 - Serverless Option: Can use AWS Fargate to run containers without managing servers.

 - Auto Scaling: Automatically adjusts the number of running containers based on demand.

 - Load Balancing: Integrates with AWS ALB/NLB to distribute traffic across containers.

 - Task Definitions: Defines how containers should run (CPU, memory, networking, etc.).

## Use Case:

* You define a Task Definition that specifies which Docker image (from ECR) to run.

* ECS then deploys and manages the containers across AWS infrastructure.

## How ECS & ECR Work Together
 - Build → You package your Java app into a Docker image.

 - Store → Push the image to Amazon ECR.

 - Deploy → ECS pulls the image from ECR and runs it in a cluster.

 - Scale → ECS manages scaling, load balancing, and failover.

This combination provides a fully managed, serverless way to deploy containerized applications without worrying about infrastructure.
